**Muainishi wa Jenomu** (Swahili for *Genome Classifier*) is a sophisticated, AI-driven web application designed for comprehensive human genome analysis. Leveraging the power of Google's Gemini API, this tool provides world-class bioinformatics insights through an intuitive and visually rich interface.

Users can upload their genome sequence files (or use provided samples) and perform five distinct types of analysis. The results are presented in two convenient formats: a clean, interactive graphical visualization and the raw, structured JSON data.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Intuitive File Handling**: Easy file uploads with a drag-and-drop interface.
- **Sample Datasets**: Start analyzing immediately with pre-loaded genome samples.
- **Five Powerful Analysis Types**:
  - **üß¨ Classification**: Uncover genetic ancestry and haplogroups.
  - **üìä Segmentation**: Identify and map key genomic segments like genes and regulatory regions.
  - **ü¶† Viral Integration**: Scan for potential viral DNA integrated into the genome.
  - **‚ö° Mutation Tracking**: Pinpoint and analyze significant genetic mutations.
  - **üíä Pharmacogenomics**: Predict drug responses and metabolic phenotypes based on genetic markers.
- **Dual-View Results**: Toggle between beautiful, interactive **Graphical Visualizations** and the detailed **Raw JSON Data**.
- **Modern & Responsive UI**: A sleek, dark-themed interface built with React and Tailwind CSS that works seamlessly across all devices.
- **AI-Powered**: All analyses are performed by Google's advanced Gemini model, ensuring high-quality, structured results.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This is a fully client-side application and requires no backend or complex build setup to run.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- A Google Gemini API Key.

### Setup & Running

1.  **Clone the repository or download the source files.**

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    This application requires a Google Gemini API key to function. The key is accessed via the `process.env.API_KEY` variable in the code.

    To make your key available to the application, you'll need to serve the files in an environment where this variable can be set. A simple way to do this for local development is to use a tool like `vite`.

    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    - Add your API key to the `.env` file:
      ```
      VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
      ```
    - The code internally expects `process.env.API_KEY`, so you may need to adjust the service file (`services/geminiService.ts`) to read `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY` if you use Vite, or configure your server to inject the environment variable correctly.

3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
    If you've set up a local server (like `vite` or `http-server`), navigate to the provided local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

## üî¨ How It Works

1.  **Upload Data**: The user uploads a genome sequence file (e.g., FASTA, VCF) or selects a sample. The file content is read directly in the browser.
2.  **Select Analysis**: The user chooses one of the five analysis types.
3.  **Call Gemini API**: A prompt is constructed containing the analysis type, a sample of the genome data, and a detailed JSON schema for the desired output format. This is sent to the Gemini API.
4.  **Receive Structured Data**: The Gemini API processes the request and returns a JSON object that conforms to the requested schema.
5.  **Render Results**: The application parses the JSON response and uses it to render both the interactive visualizations and the raw data view.
